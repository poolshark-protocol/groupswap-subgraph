DONE- there is a never a scenario where a GroupExecution would happen without a GroupOrder
the reason is that we are checking our Subgraph for GroupOrders that already exist
therefore a GroupExecution without a GroupOrder is not possible

DONE - in the case that a deposit happens on the same block as a GroupExecution on an earlier index, we need to preserve that/those transaction hashes
this is so those OpenOrders are not lost when the next GroupExecution occurs

orders that are cancelled need to be removed from the orderTxnHashes list

group amounts updated when cancelling/withdrawing

we want to see both the deposit, withdraw request, and transfer token hashes in the end

subtract out the gas for deposits that weren't included in that swap

you should not be able to cancel if the group is going to execute that same block

we need to handle users trying to submit multiple cancel/withdraw requests on the same block
